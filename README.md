# Efficient Reinforcement Learning with the novel N-Step Method and V-network, in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics.

PyTorch implementation of N-TD3 algorithm. If you use our code or data please cite the paper.

Method is tested on [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) continuous control tasks in [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). 
Networks are trained using [torch 1.3.0](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and Python 3.7.
